# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is the automated process of analyzing text data and sorting it into sentiments positive, negative or neutral. Here we analyze tweets for discrimination information.

## data set
The data is downloaded from this github repository:
https://github.com/sharmaroshan/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## model
### tf-idf vector space representation

### dummy classification to define the baseline of the F1-score
Logistic Regression, support vector machine and random forest models are applied and compared. 

### Over-sampling methods in imbalanced classification
To deal with the imbalance classification problem, the borderline-SMOTE technique, which is one of the over-sampling methods, is applied after the tf-idf transformation.
